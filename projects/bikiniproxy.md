# BikiniProxy 

BikiniProxy is a novel technique to provide self-healing for the web.
BikiniProxy is designed as an HTTP proxy that uses five self-healing strategies to rewrite the buggy HTML and Javascript code.

## Self-healing Strategies

1. *HTTP/HTTPS Redirector* that changes HTTP URLs to HTTPS URLs.
2. *HTML Element Creator* that creates missing HTML elements.
3. *Library Injector* injects missing libraries in the page.
4. *Line Skipper* wraps a statement with an if to prevent invalid object access.
5. *Object Creator* initializes a variable with an empty object to prevent further null dereferences.

## DeadClick

DeadClick is a novel benchmark of JavaScript errors that are triggered in large production web applications.
This benchmark has been constructed with a unique methodology based crawling the web for finding errors and advanced proxying to ensure that those errors can be reliably reproduced.
The final benchmark contains 555 JavaScript reproducible production errors.
