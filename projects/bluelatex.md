# \BlueLaTeX

[\BlueLaTeX](http://bluelatex.org) aims to provide a tool chain to easily write documents collaboratively.


The first intended audience of \BlueLaTeX is the academic world (for now!), 
by integrating concepts and lifecycles particularly well-suited for these kind of documents, 
but it can be used for any other kind of document.
