	<p class="description">
      Ph.D. student in software engineering, he focus on automatic patch generation to fix applications directly in production environment.
    </p>
</div>

**About Me**: Ph.D. student in last year at University of Lille, France. I'm currently employed by INRIA Lille in the team Spirals that is specialized on "Self-adaptation for distributed services and large software systems".
My research interest is in automatic software repair and especially in automatic patch generation for the production environment.
The goal of this thesis is to speed up the deployment of patches by reducing the amount of human intervention.

**Quick Biography**: Ph.D. student since 2015 at University of Lille; M.S. degrees, Computer Science, from the University of Lille; B.A., Computer Science, from Institut Paul Lambin in Belgium. During my studies, I did several internships as well in the industry (Microsoft Innovation Center, Emakina) as in the academic (KTH, CERN).
I also created and maintain several [open-source projects](/projects/) for research purposes and more.

	description="International internship at KTH in the Theoretical Computer Science department. I worked on a new patch generation technique. This technique aims to fix automatically bug in websites. We adopted a crowdsourced approach where all the user contribute to the detection and repair of the bugs."

	description="The motivation of my thesis is to improve automatic patch generation techniques.
  The state of the art techniques still rely on the developer to reproduce the bug, they rely on a failing test-case that describes the bug.
  My thesis presents new approaches that aim to removes the developer intervention during the patch generation."

	description="I worked on the Nopol project, a test-suite-based automatic program repair approach that fixes buggy conditions. 
  Firstly, I used symbolic execution engine to extend Nopol repair scope to buggy arithmetic statements. 
  Secondly, I worked on the first patch synthesizer that generates patches that contains complex method invocations."

	description="I worked with CERN security team, where I created a scanner that detects misconfigurations and outdated libraries in the thousands of WEB servers of the CERN institution.
  The goal of this scanner was to ensure that all the servers do not have known security issues."
