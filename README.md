**About Me**: I am currently doing a Post-Doc at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. My research intersts are software debloating and automatic patch generation, bugs indentification, developer interaction with bots. I did my Ph.D. at University of Lille, France on automatic patch generation in production. 

**Quick Biography**: Post-doc at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden; previous post-doc at INESC in Portugal; Ph.D. from University of Lille, France; M.S. degrees, Computer Science, from the University of Lille; B.A., Computer Science, from Institut Paul Lambin in Belgium. During my studies, I did several internships as well in the industry (Microsoft Innovation Center, Emakina) as in the academic (KTH, CERN).
I also created and maintain several [open-source projects](/projects/) for research purposes and more.

	description="The motivation of my thesis is to improve automatic patch generation techniques.
  The state of the art techniques still rely on the developer to reproduce the bug, they rely on a failing test-case that describes the bug.
  My thesis presents new approaches that aim to removes the developer intervention during the patch generation."
