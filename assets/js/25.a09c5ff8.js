BikiniProxy is designed as an HTTP proxy that uses five self-healing strategies to rewrite the buggy HTML and Javascript code. We evaluate BikiniProxy with a new benchmark of 555 reproducible Javascript errors, DeadClick. We create DeadClick by randomly crawling the Internet and collect all web pages that contain Javascript errors. Then, we observe how BikiniProxy heals those errors by collecting and comparing the traces of the original and healed pages.

However, test suites are in essence input-output specifications and are thus typically inadequate for completely specifying the expected behavior of the program under repair. Consequently, the patches generated by test suite based repair techniques can just overfit to the used test suite, and fail to generalize to other tests. We deeply analyze the overfitting problem in program repair and give a classification of this problem. This classification will help the community to better understand and design techniques to defeat the overfitting problem. We further propose and evaluate an approach called UnsatGuided, which aims to alleviate the overfitting problem for synthesis-based repair techniques with automatic test case generation. The approach uses additional automatically generated tests to strengthen the repair constraint used by synthesis-based repair techniques. We analyze the effectiveness of UnsatGuided: 1) analytically with respect to alleviating two different kinds of overfitting issues; 2) empirically based on an experiment over the 224 bugs of the Defects4J repository. The main result is that automatic test generation is effective in alleviating one kind of overfitting issue–regression introduction, but due to oracle problem, has minimal positive impact on alleviating the other kind of overfitting issue–incomplete fixing.",authors:[{lastname:"Yu",firstname:"Zhongxing",url:"https://sites.google.com/site/yuzxpage/"},{lastname:"Martinez",firstname:"Matias",url:"http://www.martinezmatias.com/"},{lastname:"Danglot",firstname:"Benjamin",url:"https://danglotb.github.io/"},{lastname:"Durieux",firstname:"Thomas",url:"https://durieux.me"},{lastname:"Monperrus",firstname:"Martin",url:"https://www.monperrus.net/martin/"}],role:"Proceedings at Empirical Software Engineering."}}),e._v(" "),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01774223/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("PDF"),a("OutboundLink")],1),e._v(" • "),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/Spirals-Team/test4repair-experiments",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Source code"),a("OutboundLink")],1)],1)]),e._v(" "),a("li",[a("p",[a("cv",{attrs:{name:"Exhaustive Exploration of the Failure-oblivious Computing Search Space",url:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09722",date:"2018",description:"High-availability of software systems requires automated handling of crashes in presence of errors.

In this work, we deeply study 395 patches of the Defects4J dataset. Quantitative properties (patch size and spreading) were automatically extracted, whereas qualitative ones (repair actions and patterns) were manually extracted using a thematic analysis-based approach. We found that 1) the median size of Defects4J patches is four lines, and almost 30% of the patches contain only addition of lines; 2) 92% of the patches change only one file, and 38% has no spreading at all; 3) the top-3 most applied repair actions are addition of method calls, conditionals, and assignments, occurring in 77% of the patches; and 4) nine repair patterns were found for 95% of the patches, where the most prevalent, appearing in 43% of the patches, is on conditional blocks.

The result of our experiment shows that the considered state-of-the-art repair methods can generate patches for 47 out of 224 bugs.

We have manually analyzed 84 different patches to assess their real correctness. In total, 9 real Java bugs can be correctly repaired with a test-suite based repair. This analysis shows that test-suite based repair suffers from under-specified bugs, for which trivial or incorrect patches still pass the test suite. With respect to practical applicability, it takes on average 14.8 minutes to find a patch. The experiment was done on a scientific grid, totaling 17.6 days of computation time.

This approach takes a buggy program as well as a test suite as input and generates a patch with a conditional expression as output. The test suite is required to contain passing test cases to model the expected behavior of the program and at least one failing test case that reveals the bug to be repaired. The process of Nopol consists of three major phases. First, Nopol employs angelic fix localization to identify expected values of a condition during the test execution. Second, runtime trace collection is used to collect variables and their actual values, including primitive data types and objected-oriented features (e.g., nullness checks), to serve as building blocks for patch generation. Third, Nopol encodes these collected data into an instance of a Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) problem; then a feasible solution to the SMT instance is translated back into a code patch. We evaluate Nopol on 22 real-world bugs (16 bugs with a buggy if conditions and six bugs with missing preconditions) on two large open-source projects, namely Apache Commons Math and Apache Commons Lang. Empirical analysis on these bugs shows that our approach can effectively fix bugs with buggy if conditions and missing preconditions.
